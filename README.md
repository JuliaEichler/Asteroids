###Project
The project reinterpreted the good, old Asteroids game and turned it into a collaborative experience. It required 4 users to operate the controllers. Further information can be found on [http://juliaeichler.de/2012/05/all-for-one-one-for-all/](http://juliaeichler.de/2012/05/all-for-one-one-for-all/).

###Hardware
2 Arduinos sending the controllers' input via XBees wirelessly and another Arduino via wire to the computer running the Asteroids game.
The computer is connected to a projector to display the game onto a wall.
